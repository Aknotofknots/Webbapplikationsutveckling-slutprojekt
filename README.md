## Purpose and functionality of the finished product

I've made a music news blog where you can search for random news of an artist and then - if you feel like it - listen to a preview
sample of a song from an album by searching the Spotify API.
I've spent a lot of time on the details to make it feel like a genuine product.

## A short description of the process

Before i began making this app i gathered reference material, in this case i looked a lot at various music blogs to get a feel for how they were built. Initially i tried to stick to the progressive enhancement design philosophy(with a mobile first mind-set), building a stable experience for small devices first and gradually introduce more advanced features, but somewhere along the way i noticed that i diverged from this path, rather adopting the graceful degradation way of thinking. This lead me to rewrite a lot of code.

I used Bootstrap and custom CSS to style the page, mostly vanilla Javascript for DOM-manipulation and jQuery for effects and Ajax calls.
The Api:s i've used in this project is the [Webhose Api](https://webhose.io/web-search-api) to get the news information, the [Last FM](http://www.last.fm/api) and [Spotify Api](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/):s for pictures, biographys and music.
