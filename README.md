# By Christian Ahls√©n
======================
### School: Lernia
### Program: Frontend-Javascript Developer
### Course: Webbapplication development

## A short description of the process
I've tried to use the progressive enhancement design philosophy rather than graceful degradation throughout the design process.
I used Bootstrap and custom CSS to style the page, mostly vanilla Javascript for DOM-manipulation and jQuery for effects and Ajax calls.
The Api:s i've used in this project is the [Webhose Api](https://webhose.io/web-search-api) to get the news information, the [Last FM](http://www.last.fm/api) and [Spotify Api](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/):s for pictures, biographys and music.

## Purpose and funcionality of the finished product

I've made a music news blog where you can search for random news of an artist and then - if you feel like it - listen to a preview
sample of a song from an album by searching the Spotify API.

I've spent a lot of time on the details to make it feel like a genuine product.
